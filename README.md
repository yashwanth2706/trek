## Trek â€” A Command-line Tool to Visualize Directory Structures

Inspired by the `tree` command, **trek** is a lightweight tool that helps you visually explore the directory structure of your projects.

When working on large or deeply nested projects, it's time-consuming to manually check if files and folders are properly organized. Trek simplifies this by "trekking" through all directories and subdirectories, displaying a clean and readable tree view in your terminal.

Ideal for:
- Project overviews
- Codebase organization checks
- Quick file inspections
